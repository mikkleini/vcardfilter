vCard filter
------------

I created this script because i had hard times getting my contacts with phone numbers only from Android to Windows phone.
Android exports vCard file together with email contacts, but i don't want them to flood the screen. Neither on Android or Windows i couldn't find any options to filter such contacts.
So this small script does a very primitive job and extracts the contacts with phone number into other vcf file.
Hope it's useful for other as well.
